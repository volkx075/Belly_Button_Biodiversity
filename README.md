# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Purpose
Rosa needs our help to complete the dashboard. She wants us to create visuals of the bacterial data for each volunteer. First, we want to create a bar graph to show the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. Then we will create a bubble chart showing the bacteria culters per sample. Lastly, we will create a guage chart to show belly button washing frequency. These charts will help volunteers to be able to see and understand their data in an clear way.
